        <h1>Cognitive Delay Usability Study</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, and thank you for agreeing to participate in this study.
        </p><p>
            When you click the "Start" button below, you will be presented with a list of emails.
            Your job today is to delete emails that <b>are not</b> from the microsoft.com domain and
            archive emails that <b>are</b> from the microsoft.com domain.
            There will be a delete button (with a <i class="fa-solid fa-trash-can" title="Delete"></i> trashcan icon)
            and an archive button (with an <i class="fa-solid fa-box-archive" title="Archive"></i> archive box icon)
            to the right of each email summary in the list.
        </p><p>
            The study will have two phases, each with the same duration of a minute.
            And that's it really, you'll be done in a little more than two minutes.
            The data is completely anonymous and will be used only for research purposes.
            No cookies or trackers of any kind are being generated by this study.

                Congratulations, you finished phase one of this test. Please press the start button again when you are ready for phase two.
                Phase two should feel very similar to phase one.
